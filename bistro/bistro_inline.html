    <h2>Low and Slow</h2><br>
    <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new
        cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide
        cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
        in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
        set to the target temperature you want the food
        to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks,
        Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature
        poaching.</p>
    <p><em>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon
        with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef
        table, contact us before November 30.</p></em><br>
